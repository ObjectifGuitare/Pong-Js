pong in pure javascript with a little bit of sun

kinda managed responsive with js because why not

here is the github page : https://objectifguitare.github.io/Pong-Js/

Arrow keys UP and DOWN to move right paddle

A and W to move left paddle

This was a group project during my training at BeCode, I did all the game logic, including the approximate paddle hitboxes & buggy left-side score (it's fixed when you reload the page).
